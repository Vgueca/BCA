# Multivariate Statistics Project: Breast Cancer Analysis

## Project Description
This project aims to apply multivariate statistical techniques to analyze a public dataset on breast cancer.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a public dataset available at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/17/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: We clean and prepare the data for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: We perform exploratory analysis to understand the features and relationships in our data.
3. **Multivariate Statistical Modeling**: We apply multivariate statistical techniques to uncover patterns and relationships in the data.

## Results
The results of our analysis are presented at the "Report" folder, where we have documented thoroughly all the steps we have made as well as the meaning of the different results obtained.
